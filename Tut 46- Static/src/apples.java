// Static variables are shared
// Static keyword means every object shares the same variable
// this removes the need of having to make a method that updates a variable each time it is changed or incremented
/** for example if you wanted to keep track of the 
 * amount of members in a club, you want it to be
 * shared as you don't need a separate variable to 
 * keep each increment
**/

// this program makes a list of people in a club
// and updates each time someone joins
